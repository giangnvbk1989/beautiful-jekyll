<p align="justify"><b>Title:</b> Towards SDN/NFV-based Mobile Packet Core: Benefits, Challenges, and Potential Solutions</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Abstract:</b> In mobile networks, the mobile core plays a crucial role in providing connectivity between mobile user devices and external packet data networks such as the Internet. Through years, along with the dramatical changes in radio access networks, the mobile core has also been evolved from being a partial packet-based network in its first generation (1G) to become a purely packet-based network called the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) in the current generation (4G). In recent years, the explosion of mobile data traffic and devices and the advent of new services has led to the investigation of the next generation of mobile networks, i.e, 5G. A wide range of technologies has been proposed to be candidates for the development of 5G. Among other technology candidates, Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) have widely been considered to be key enablers for the network architecture of 5G, especially the mobile packet core (MPC) network.</p> 

<p align="justify">This thesis aims at identifying challenges and problems while applying SDN and NFV to re-achitect the current MPC network towards 5G and addressing some of them. To this end, we start reviewing important use cases and requirements that are driving the development of 5G and its use of SDN and NFV in its core part. Next, we conduct a comprehensive literature review of the state-of-the-art work leveraging SDN and NFV to re-design the 4G EPC architecture. Through this survey work, several research questions for future work have been identified and we contribute to address two of them in this thesis. Firstly, since most of the current works focus on unicast services, we propose an SDN/NFV-based MPC architecture for providing multicast and broadcast services. Our numerical results show that the proposed architecture can reduce the total signaling cost. Secondly, we address the question regarding the scalability of the control plane. We take the Mobility Management Entity (MME) - one of the EPC key control plane entities - as a case study. In our work, the MME is deployed as a cluster of multiple virtual instances (vMMEs) and a front-end load balancer. We focus on investigating different approaches to achieve better load balancing among these vMMEs, which in turns contributing to the scalability improvement. Our experimental results suggest that carefully selected load balancing algorithms can significantly reduce the control plane latency.</p>
